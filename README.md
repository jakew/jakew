### Jake Winters 

Hey, there!

I'm Jake. I've been programming since 2004, professionally since 2014. I have an
Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

Since 2018, I mostly program in Go, and things related to Docker, containers and 
Kubernetes, though I often mess around with Swift and iOS things.

Here's a few projects on here you can check out:

- [cargo](https://github.com/jakew/cargo) â€” Write multiple Dockerfiles from a template.
- [minass](https://github.com/jakew/minass) â€” A _very_ minimal assertion library, use with Go's "testing" package.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/jakew/dotfiles) â€” My ZSH setup. Because I'm a nerd.
